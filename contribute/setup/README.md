# Setup

### Local Setup

This page provides detailed instructions for setting up the CREDEBL platform locally. It is intended for two main audiences:

1. **Contributors** – Developers who wish to contribute to the CREDEBL codebase. A working local environment is essential for testing changes, submitting pull requests, and verifying functionality before contributions are reviewed.
2. **Custom Implementers** – Developers or teams who want to customize specific components of the CREDEBL platform for their own use cases. A local setup provides the flexibility to experiment and adapt the system to meet unique requirements.

Setting up the project locally enables developers to:

* Understand the system architecture and dependencies.
* Debug and test features in an isolated environment.
* Iterate quickly without affecting the deployed production or staging environments.
* Contribute to the project following the best practices and guidelines outlined in the Contributions Guide.

> **Note:** This guide assumes a basic understanding of Git, Docker, and package managers (like pnpm or yarn). If you're new to any of these, we recommend reviewing the relevant documentation before proceeding.
