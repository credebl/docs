# Platform APIs

## Platform APIs Overview

Our Platform APIs enable seamless integration with our system, allowing you to interact with key services and functionalities programmatically. These APIs are designed to be intuitive and efficient, providing developers with tools to automate processes, retrieve data, and build applications that leverage our platform's capabilities.

Before diving into the detailed API documentation, ensure you have the necessary API credentials for authentication, as most endpoints require secure access. The APIs support standard RESTful methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and return data in JSON format.

To explore the full list of available APIs, including detailed usage instructions, endpoint descriptions, and example requests, please visit the [Platform APIs Documentation](https://api.credebl.id/api).\


## Agent APIs Overview

The Agent APIs provide powerful tools for interacting with our agent-based services, enabling secure communication, data exchange, and identity verification processes. These APIs are designed to facilitate seamless integration with our decentralized systems, allowing developers to manage agent operations, automate workflows, and connect with other services efficiently.

Key features of the Agent APIs include authentication support, secure messaging, and flexible data handling capabilities. They are built to be robust and developer-friendly, supporting RESTful conventions with clear response formats in JSON.

For a detailed guide on how to integrate with these APIs, including comprehensive endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, and best practices, please refer to the [Agent APIs Documentation](https://agent.credebl.id/docs/#/).
