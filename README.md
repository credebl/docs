### CREDEBL PLATFORM <a href="#platform" id="platform"></a>

[Platform](https://github.com/credebl/platform) provides a set of scalable services to manage decentralized identity and verifiable credentials (VC) system. It enables developers to build Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions that provide enhanced privacy and security. It is designed for scalability to support population-scale SSI implementations.&#x20;

It provides tools for digital credential management and verification, allowing organizations to easily issue and manage credentials with ease. It is built on a micro-services architecture to support large-scale enterprise applications.

Platform supports multiple ledger options (like Indy and Polygon) and also ledger-less credential issuance using methods like did:web, did:key and did:peer.

### CREDEBL STUDIO <a href="#studio" id="studio"></a>

[Studio](https://github.com/credebl/studio) is web front-end for the entire Platform, built using Astro, React, Flowbite, and Tailwind CSS, allowing administrators & users to easily access & manage all the Platform features using a simple web interface.

### ARIES AGENT

In the context of decentralized identity systems, an agent generally refers to a software component or service that facilitates peer-to-peer interactions and data exchange operations between various entities in the system.

Agents leverage the Aries protocol implementations built into **Credo** & **ACA-Py**.

There are two types of agents that organizations can use, each serving different needs based on the deployment model and use case: **Shared Agents** and **Dedicated Agents**.

A shared agent refers to an agent that is used by multiple entities or tenants, rather than being dedicated to a single entity. If the tenancy is set to true, it typically means that the system or agent supports multi-tenancy, or if the tenancy is set to false, it means that the agent does not support the multi-tenancy.

### **ADEYA Mobile SDK**

Built on the strong foundation of Credo, the ADEYA Mobile Wallet SDK is a React-Native SDK helps mobile developers to easily build SSI features with into existing mobile apps or a new one, enables interoperability and seamless connectivity for secure data exchange.
