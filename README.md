### CREDEBL PLATFORM <a href="#platform" id="platform"></a>

[Platform](https://github.com/credebl/platform) is an Open source, Open standards based Decentralised Identity & Verifiable Credentials Platform. The CREDEBL platform is an open-source, decentralized identity and verifiable credentials (VC) system that adheres to global standards such as W3C’s Decentralized Identifiers (DID) and Verifiable Credentials. It enables developers to build Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) solutions that provide enhanced privacy and security. Designed for scalability, the platform supports multiple ledger options (like Indy and Polygon) and ledger-less credential issuance using methods like did:web, did:key and did:peer.

CREDEBL provides tools for digital credential management and verification, allowing organizations to issue and manage credentials with ease. It is built on a micro-services architecture to support large-scale enterprise applications.

### CREDEBL STUDIO <a href="#studio" id="studio"></a>

[Studio](https://github.com/credebl/studio) is front-end for the CREDEBL Platform, built using Astro, React, Flowbite, and Tailwind CSS, this front-end requires specific setup. In this section, you will find instructions for cloning the Studio repository, installing dependencies, and running the frontend application. These steps will help you get the UI up and running, allowing you to contribute to its development effectively.

### CREDEBL AGENT

In the context of decentralized identity systems, an agent generally refers to a software component or service that facilitates peer-to-peer interactions and data exchange operations between various entities in the system.

There are two main types of agents that organizations can use, each serving different needs based on the deployment model and use case: Shared Agents and Dedicated Agents.

A shared agent refers to an agent that is used by multiple entities or tenants, rather than being dedicated to a single entity. If the tenancy is set to true, it typically means that the system or agent supports multi-tenancy, or if the tenancy is set to false, it means that the agent does not support the multi-tenancy.

### **ADEYA Mobile SDK**

Built on the strong foundation of Credo and open W3C standards for Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs), our ADEYA Mobile SDK for Mobile Wallets enable you to easily integrate with existing applications or build new ones, achieving[^1] global interoperability and seamless connectivity.
